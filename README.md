# KPMG-VIRTUAL-DATA-ANALYSIS

KPMG data analysis that involves:
  1. ## Data Quality Assessment
     
     Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis
     
  2. Data Insights

     Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.
     
  3. Data Insights and Presentation

     Using visualisations to present insights
     
In all the above processes I used **R program** to clean, re-orient data, produce extra variables useful in analysis and **Tableau for visualisation**.
